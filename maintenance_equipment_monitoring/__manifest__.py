       The purpose of this module is to monitor other odoo databases to see the
       status of their server. In order to query other databases the need
       "maintenance_monitoring_status" or "maintenance_monitoring_status_extension" installed.

       In order to specify which database you want to monitor you fill the Monitor URL
       field on the equipment view and there is  a ping button to trigger this query.
       The url needs to look like: http ://hostname/monitoring/status?db=databasename.

       There is also cron job called "Ping Remote Server" that will ping every
       60 minutes to all equipment that has "Is Monitored" field set to true.
